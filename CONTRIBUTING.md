Thank you for showing an interest in contributing to Eik ðŸ§¡

Commits should follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

This repo uses [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automate releases whenever changes are merged to the default branch.

We use JSDoc to generate type definitions. If you're new to that workflow, [the TypeScript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) and [this blogpost by Alex Harri](https://alexharri.com/blog/jsdoc-as-an-alternative-typescript-syntax) are good starting points.
